# LLMCostsLoggingClassesPython

This repo contains the source code for the Python class you might need to log into llmcosts.fyi

We wouldn't normally expect you to need to install from source, and this code is very simple.

You need an API key from llmcosts.fyi. Reference code, prepopulated with your API key is available to users of that site
